## Closer to camera

### Description

Animate the depth of an object in camera space. <br />
Intended as a tweaker tool for later anim stages where timings have been established.

It works best by selecting one controller as the target. The tool supports multi-controller selections by calculating the mid point of the controllers.<br />
